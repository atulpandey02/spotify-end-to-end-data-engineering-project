# Spotify-End-To-End-Data-Engineering-Project

###Introduction

In this project, I built a serverless ETL pipeline using the Spotify API and AWS. It extracts playlist data via Lambda, stores raw data in S3, transforms it using another Lambda, and catalogs it with AWS Glue. The data is queried in Amazon Athena for analysis.
